# pihole
pihole homelab project

## scripts for the homelab project:
### Gemini
Gemini's function is to sync the configs between a ssh share key session of the 2 pi's

### keep alive
Keep Alive's function is to check the status of each pi over a virtual IP, which is a psuedo "HA"
Devices in the peer will check in periodically and swap master slave status depending on reachability.
